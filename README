This program receives an integer in the argument vector.
The program creates 2 child processes - one for bubble sort
and the other for quick sort. The program also creates a pipe in order
to communicate with it's children.
The parent process creates an array with 50000 cells and inserts random integers.
The children processes then sort the arrays using either bubble or quicksort.
Each child process sends to its father process via the pipe the amount
of time it took them to sort the array. The father process enters the times taken
into 2 respective arrays. The father repeats this process of randomizing an
array and sending it to its children to sort 50 times.
At the end of this process, the father goes over the two arrays where he collected
the times taken and calculates the minimum, maximum and average
times for each sorting methods.
The parent prints in the command line these calculations and when it is
finished it prints its own executable time.

The average running time for the parent process is: ####.
In comparison, the average running time for the parent process in program
ex1a was: ####.

Compile: gcc -Wall ex3a.c -o ex3a

Run: ./ex3a <integer>

Input: When running the executable file, add integer.
	   Example: ./ex1ba1.exe 17

############# update following:
Output: Average bubble sort time, average quick sort time,
		minimum bubble sort time, minimum quick sort time,
		maximum bubble sort time, maximum bubble sort time,
		Parent sort time.
		Example: 4.505360 4.520000 4.449000 0.006000 4.598000 4.598000
				228.755000

In this program, the parent program creates 3 children processes. 







Compile: gcc -Wall ex3a.c -o ex3a

Run: ./ex3a <integer>

Input: When running the executable file, add integer.
      Example: ./ex1ba1.exe 17


Output:
